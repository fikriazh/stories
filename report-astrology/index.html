Everything you achieve in life is as the result of sheer determination and effort. In reality, nothing of lasting value comes to you without hard work and sacrifice.

These two planets only come together every 172 years; most recently in 1993 and prior to that in 1821.

To some people, you are an exciting person to be around; to others you are unconventional and hard for them to understand. You need to take care not to come across as overly eccentric, because you may isolate yourself socially. You are intrinsically restless and will tend to have many changes of environment throughout the course of your life.</p><p>Uranus Square Midheaven (6d 40m A)
A born reformer, others see you as a unique personality who is strongly individualistic. Professionally, you will choose a career that is unusual or innovative in some way, or you could be attracted to modern occupations, involving the latest technological advancements. One word of warning, this aspect can sometimes cause reckless and rash behavior, which can lead to sudden reversals of fortune or disgrace.</p><p>Neptune Sextile Pluto (6d 52m S)
Neptune and Pluto are the solar system&rsquo;s slowest moving planets; consequently, aspects between them last for a great number of years and their effects are more collective than personal. Since 1940 and continuing until about 2040 they are in sextile aspect to each other. The major effect of this is to accentuate spiritual awareness and development en masse. You are part of a generation that is intent on exploring and refining the inner aspect of life and consciousness itself. You will be aware of a universal interest in metaphysical subjects, clairvoyance and psychical research.</p><p>Neptune Conjunct Ascendant (4d 07m A)
